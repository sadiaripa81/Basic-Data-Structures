// You have a singly linked list which is empty initially. Then you will be given Q queries. In each query you will be given two values X and V.

// If X is 0 that means you will insert the value V to the head of the linked list.
// If X is 1 then you will insert the value V to the tail of the linked list.
// If X is 2 then you will delete the value Vth index of the linked list. Assume that index starts from 0. If the index is invalid, then you shouldn't perform the deletion.
// After each query you need to print the linked list.
